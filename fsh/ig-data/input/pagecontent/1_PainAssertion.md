### Introduction
Pain is a condition that asserted about an individual as a whole.  Not that the whoel body has pain but rather that the individual has pain.  It may often be due to antother, related condition or event but it is usually recorded as a disctrete item on a problem list that needs to be tracked over time along with all of its qualifying data.  Because of these factors, Pain was profiled as an assertion using the Condition resource.
