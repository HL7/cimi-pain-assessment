# Introduction

*This is the current integration build of the Pain Assessment implementation guide.*

Pain is the most commonly documented symptom in health care.  There is a large need to standardize the data surrounding pain, its qualifying elements, and related observations.  

## Scope

The scope of this implementation guide is to create FHIR profiles for the assertion of pain with all of its qualifiers (character, exacerbating factors, alleviating factors, pain radiation, etc.) as well as create observation profiles for pain instruments and other commonly recorded observations about pain.  Also included are profiles for a Pain Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse.
