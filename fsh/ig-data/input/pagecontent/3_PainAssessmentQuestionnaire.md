## Pain Assessment Questionnaire

To facilitate the collection of all the pieces of data that would accompany the assetion of Pain, a profile of the Questionnaire resourece was created.  These accmonpanying pieces of data are extensions in the Pain Assertion profile but are represented as defined questions in this questionnaire profile.  LOINC bindings are used wherever possible to defing each question.  The answerOption for each question is also retsrticted to a value set of SNNOMED CT terms.  This profile is given as a possible means of collecting the data that would populate the Pain Assertion profile, not as a alternative to it.
